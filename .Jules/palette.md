## 2026-02-10 - Enhancing Hero Background
**Learning:** Adding subtle background decorations like a dotted grid and animated blurred blobs can significantly improve the "premium" feel of a hero section without requiring complex assets or distracting the user.
**Action:** Use CSS radial-gradients for grids and framer-motion with blur filters for blobs to fill empty space elegantly.

## 2025-02-11 - Transition from Waitlist to App Experience
**Learning:** Transitioning from a "Waitlist" model to a "Get Started" model requires not just updating buttons, but creating a functional entry point that provides immediate value to guest users while maintaining the brand's premium aesthetic.
**Action:** Use high-quality dashboard layouts with Bento-style sections and guest-specific branding for application entry points to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

## 2025-02-12 - Mobile-First Navigation with BottomNav
**Learning:** For complex SaaS or marketplace applications, a sidebar alone is insufficient for mobile. A fixed Bottom Navigation bar combined with horizontal-scrolling categories provides a much more "cool" and native app-like experience.
**Action:** Implement `BottomNav` components for mobile viewports and use horizontal scrolling (`overflow-x-auto`) for secondary navigation/categories to keep the UI compact and easy to navigate with one thumb.
## 2025-05-14 - Dark Mode Implementation with next-themes
**Learning:** When implementing dark mode in Next.js with `next-themes`, use `resolvedTheme` instead of `theme` to account for system settings. Ensure hydration safety by checking a `mounted` state. Refactor hardcoded hex colors to semantic CSS variables early to ensure global consistency.
**Action:** Always prefer `resolvedTheme` for icon logic and toggle states. Use semantic classes like `bg-background` and `text-foreground` in new components from the start.

## 2025-02-13 - Keyboard Accessibility for Hover-Only Elements
**Learning:** Interactive elements that appear only on hover (e.g., Quick View or Wishlist buttons on product cards) are completely inaccessible to keyboard users unless they are also made visible on focus. Simply having them in the DOM is not enough if they remain invisible and lack focus styles.
**Action:** Always pair `group-hover:opacity-100` with `focus:opacity-100` (and corresponding transform classes) and ensure clear focus rings for these "hidden" interactive elements.
